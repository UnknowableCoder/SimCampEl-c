# SimCampEl (the C version)
A simple 2d electric field and electric charge simulator written in C using GTK for the UI and Cairo for the representation.

# Compiling

Simply compile with any C compiler that supports GTK.

# Warnings and Caveats

This was the final project for our first course in Programming, so the UI and comments are in Portuguese. Maybe some day we will update them.
